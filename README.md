## SensoryBot: Your Personal AI Assistant in Telegram with File Management

SensoryBot is more than just a bot for interacting with LLM models through the Ollama API. Itâ€™s a full-fledged tool for managing your files, accessible both through Telegram and a user-friendly graphical interface.

**Key Features of SensoryBot:**

* **Local LLM Models:** Run powerful LLaMA models on your own computer, without relying on cloud services.
* **Convenient Interface:** Manage your bot and files through Telegram or with a GUI application built on PyQt6.
* **File Handling:** Send files (pdf, pptx, txt, xlsx, images) directly to the bot in Telegram or upload them via the GUI.
* **Built-in Parser:** SensoryBot automatically extracts text from PDF files, presentations, and images using pdfminer and Tesseract OCR.
* **File Management:** Store, organize, and manage all your files in one place.
* **Accessibility:** SensoryBot runs even on modest computers, successfully running llama2:3b-instruct-q6_K on a system with a GTX 1650 4GB graphics card.
